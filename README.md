# VLM Performance project

This project is created to track down RasterSources API regressions.

NOTE: at this point, this project depends on [GeoTrellis Contrib 3.14.0-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-contrib/tree/cc6b022d5f4ac1266b23962181d00cc9cce79e40),
it requires GeoTrellis Contrib local publish.
